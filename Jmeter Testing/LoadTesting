Load testing is a type of performance testing that involves simulating a high volume of users or traffic on a system to measure its ability to handle the load. 
I have performed load testing for few pages of the website. 

Here are the steps to perform load testing:

Define the objectives: Determine what you want to achieve with your load testing. This could include identifying performance bottlenecks, ensuring the system can handle expected traffic, and determining how much load the system can handle.

Identify the test scenarios: Identify the scenarios that you want to test. This could include simulating a large number of users accessing the system simultaneously, generating a high volume of transactions, or testing the system's ability to handle peak loads.

Create test data: Create realistic test data that mimics real-world usage patterns. This could include generating user accounts, creating test orders, and generating test reports.

Set up the test environment: Set up the test environment to mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This includes configuring the hardware, software, and network infrastructure.

Configure load testing tools: Configure the load testing tool to simulate the test scenarios and generate the desired load. Popular load testing tools include Apache JMeter, LoadRunner, and Gatling.
I have used Apache Jmeter for testing
Run the tests: Run the tests and monitor the system's performance. Capture the results of the tests and analyze them to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Optimize the system: Based on the results of the load testing, optimize the system to improve its performance. This could include tuning the hardware, optimizing the software, or upgrading the network infrastructure.

Repeat the tests: Repeat the load testing periodically to ensure that the system continues to perform well under high loads
