Online faculty directories make it simple for users to browse information on college and university instructors. Since this programme is convenient, students may quickly examine various college/university faculty details whenever and wherever they are needed. The user may look for the specific information on faculty members, including their name, department, courses, specialty, and areas of professional interest. This method decreased the user's time and expense. Administrators, Faculties, and students are the three parties with access to this system. Administrators have the authority to edit and manage all faculty information. To access this system, a student does not need to register or log in. The user may easily look up faculty members and examine their profiles. Databases are kept safe without spending any money on upkeep. Web development is the technology utilised.
